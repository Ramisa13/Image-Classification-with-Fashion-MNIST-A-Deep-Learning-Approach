# Image-Classification-with-Fashion-MNIST-A-Deep-Learning-Approach
This project focuses on classifying images from the Fashion-MNIST dataset The goal is to build and train a neural network using PyTorch to accurately predict the class of each image. 
#Fashion-MNIST is a dataset of Zalando's article images â€” consisting of a training set of 60,000 samples and a test set of 10,000 samples. Each samples is a 28x28 grayscale image, associated with a label corresponding to 10 classes. Intention of the Fashion-MNIST dataset is to serve as a direct drop-in replacement for the original MNIST dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms. It shares the same image size and structure of training and testing splits. The Fashion-MNIST dataset gives you more room to wiggle your experiments.
